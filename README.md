Implementing handcrafted forms can be:
1. Costly
2. Time-consuming

Especially if you need to create a very large form, in which the inputs are similar to each other, and they change frequently to meet rapidly changing business and regulatory requirements.

So, wouldn't it be more economical to create the forms dynamically? Based on metadata that describes the business object model?

That's **Vue Dynamic Forms**.
